# sentiment-analysis-of-movie-reviews
It was a small and basic sentiment analysis project. Used Vader to get the polarity of sentences. Then using the polarity score I calculated comp_score and compared it with the actual label of the review and calculated the accuracy. 

Before completing my undergrad thesis (which was also related to nlp), I did couple of small projects like this to get a better understanding of nlp.
